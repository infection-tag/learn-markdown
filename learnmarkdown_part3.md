# Links

## Regular Links
Simple links are simple. All you have to do, is keep [] around the text that you want to be linked, andadd a () in front of it. Then put the link inside the ().
Example: `[Look it up!](www.google.com)` will generate [Look it up!](www.google.com)
Pretty neat, huh?
Try it!
1. Make a link called `this lesson`. It should lead to https://github.com/infection-tag/learn-markdown.
2. Make a link called `this editor`. It should lead to https://dillinger.io or whatever it is you are using.
3. Make a link called `catz`. It should lead to http://www.funnycatpix.com/.
4. You can add [**_markdown_**](www.google.com) to links, too!
5. Take the following paragraph, and:
  *6. Make the first sentence bold.
  *7. Make The first word a link to www.duckduckgo.com.  
Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.

## Reference links
Sometimes, we want to link things _multiple_ times in a paragraph. In that case, we create something called a **reference link**.  
The way we create a reference link is by keeping [] around the text that we want highlighted; then, instead of keeping () like we do with regular links, we keep _another_ pair of square brackets. Instead of keeping a link in the square brackets, we keep a word.
Then, at the end of the document, we link the word to the website.
Confusing, isn't it? An example should help clear things up.
Example: `this is [a good way of getting things done.][todoist]` 
Then, at the end of the document (you can keep it anywhere, to be honest), we do this: `[todoist]: www.todoist.com`
Try it! Every time I say the word _cat_, I want you to link the website to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat. I also want you to italicize it. Every time I say **dog**, I want you to make it bold. I also want you to make it bold.

Yeah, I like cats. I also like dogs. I've always wanted a pet, but I could never afford one. Cats are cool. My relatives have a cat. It doesn't like me, though. It doesn't like _anyone_. They also have two dogs. They are pretty playful.
***
Keep your reference links here. They will dissapear after they are linked, so you can delete this line after they are linked.

## Images
Images can be linked with regular links. Keep in mind, you **cannot** copy-paste images, and you **cannot** use reference links.
The essenceof it is, you need to have a `!` character in front of the link. Instead of keeping the text you want to _link_ in the first pait of brackets, you keep the **"alt-text"**. The alt-text is short for _alternatve text_. That shows up when your computer cannot load the image. Usually, they keep a description of the image in there.
Example 1: `![castaways by the backyardiganz](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.P-aHRhHu7xc9_79mtWwIUAAAAA%26pid%3DApi&f=1)`
