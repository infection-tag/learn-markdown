# Lists
There are two types of lists; _numerical_ and **bulletted**.

## Bullet point lists
This is actually very simple.
* Start with an asterisk (they key above 8)
  * For an indent, put two spaces before your asterisk.
  ** for a second indent, put two asterisks before your message
Don't keep three asterisks! That will generate a bar.
***
* You can also keep _italics_ and **bold** in here!
* >Blockquotes, too!

To escape a set of bullet points, wither enter a bar (`***`), or insert a newline.

## Number lists
1. Pretty useless, to be honest.
  *2. You can indent by keeping a star behind the number.
  *3. hey.
6. Notice that the number here, in markdown, (`6.`) It shows up as a `2.` in the preview. Pretty useful, huh?
7. That's about it.
