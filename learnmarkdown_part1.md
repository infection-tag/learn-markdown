# The basics
## Italics and Bold
So, the first thing about markdown: _italics_ and **bold**.
### Italics
`Italics can be generated using _ on both ends.`
Example: `_hello_` will generate _hello_.
`Italics can ALSO be generated using *s on both ends; however, using two underscore characters will improve readability.`
Example: `*wassup*` will generate *wassup*.
### Bold
`Bold can be generated by putting two stars on either end.`
Example: `**No! Do NOT do that!**` will generate **No! Do NOT do that!**
Try it!  
Take the following conversation, but make person A **bold**, B _italics_, and C **_Bold AND italic_**.  
_NOTE: notice the order of bold and italics here. Keeping the underscores on the inside, will, again, inprove readability._
A: "I won't let them hurt you."
B: "I just want to take it all back."
[silence]
B: "I just wanted to see you smile again."
B: "Promise you'll say something if you need help?"
C: "Fine. I'll help you but you have to help me."

## Code
Just in case you need to reporesent something without formatting. _If I wanted to show the underscores on both sides on this block of text,_ I would use a block or line of code.
### Code lines
Hit the l'accent grave (`) key. If you can't find it, it's up here. 
![look below the esc key.](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.m8v2WHtukGKp_HI_0pni4AHaCd%26pid%3DApi&f=1)  
Surround the line of code with the tilde keys, and you will have a code **line**.  

Try it! Turn the following line of markdown into code.
_italiq_ **bold** **_yuh_**
### Code blocks  
Code blocks are the literal same as code _line_, but with three `s instead of one.
It also supports many lines.
Try it! Turn the following into a code block:
Hello
ad
asdfasd

## Blockquotes
A basic indent. 
All you have to do is keep a `>` symbol at the start of a line (withOUT a space in front of it).
>as**da**sd
>a _sdsd_

Try it!
Turn the quote in this paragraph into a blockquote, make the title italic, and make the author's name bold, and bolen _and_ italicize the "stupid" at the end of the line.
In A midsummer Night's Dream, by Shakespeare, the main characters are stupid. We can see this in the quote, "Lord! What fools these mortlas be!" ...god, mortals are so stupid!

## Headings
There are seven layers of headings. This is a basic thing about markdown, so I will turn this into a block of code that you can turn into regular text and back - I don't want to mess with the formatting on this document.
`#` Heading one (biggest)
`##` Heading two
`###` Heading three
`####` Heading 4
`#####` Heading five
`######` Heading 6 (the smallest; so smaill, in fact, that it is smaller than the original text.)

## Paragraphs
A paragraph is simple. However, most markdown viewers are trash, and will not allow a line break unless you follow the convention.
Say I wanted to type this:  
`Hark!`  
`Glory be!`  
Without proper formatting, this nightmare would occur:  
`Hark!Glory be!`
So, how do we create a new line? Simple! Just leave two spaces after a line.  
This is a bit hard to demonstrate, but let me show it like this;  
`Hark!□□`
`Glory be!` ; where □ represents one whitespace.
Try it! (The next three lines are exercises.)  
  
Fix this.
Now.
I can't make a newline!

###### Coincidentially, this is also the biggest part. By a lot.
